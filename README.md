AlgunosRitmos
=============

Messing around with standard algorithms in (mainly the C subset of) Visual C++...

The title is a rubbish bilingual pun :-) in that it scans a little bit like "Algorithms" but actually means "Some Rhythms" in Spanish.

I actually do like to feel there's some kind of very vague link between programming and the jazz concept of "improvising round a theme" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zLG1dDUsbU#t=0m55s).  The core of it is the idea of building something complex and powerful from a deep understanding of some fairly simple, universal principles.

So, yeah... rhythms!
