AlgunosRitmos
=============

Messing around with standard algorithms in (mainly the C subset of) Visual C++...

The title is a rubbish bilingual pun :-) in that it scans a little bit like "Algorithms" but actually means "Some Rhythms" in Spanish.

I actually do like to feel there's some kind of very vague link between programming and the jazz concept of "improvising round a theme"... so, yeah... rhythms!
